Currently, I'm President of our school's <a href="http://www.zerorobotics.ml">Zero Robotics Team</a> competing in the annual <a href="http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/">MIT Zero Robotics Competition</a>. I also win and get accepted to <a href="/hackathons.html">hackathons</a> globally. I'm also working on school work and some other outreach programs for <a href="http://www.codingandscience.com">middle school kids</a>. Last year with the Monta Vista Robotics Team, we won 1st in the Arizona Regional Competition, eventually winning 2nd in our division at the National Competition under FRC. From that time, I have decided to take numerous other robotics routes such as but not limited to the MIT Zero Robotics Competition and the International Autonomous Robot Racing Competition held in Canada.</p>
<p>Over the past few years I found myself a job at Maker Faire as the youngest employee (I was in middle school, barely over the age limit) and got an internship at MangoApps last summer. I'm looking for a robotics internship this summer if my research paper is approved. I am also part of the <a href="http://www.hsail.ml">High School Artificial Intelligence Lab</a>, creating research papers for better diagnosis. Next year, I am aiming to get one of my research papers into NIPS and be part of Stanford's ML Group as a High Schooler.
